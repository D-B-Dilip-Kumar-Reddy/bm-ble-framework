# REST / WebSocket Transport

**Status:** Phase 0 — the endpoint sweep tool (`tools/rest/probe_endpoints.py`) is
implemented; **no sweep has been run yet**, and no REST client, session, or profile
exists. Everything below the "Sweep results" heading is empty on purpose, waiting for
real-hardware evidence.

## Overview

Firmware 8.6 exposes an HTTP control API and a WebSocket event feed alongside the BLE
interface this repo was built on. Several things BLE structurally cannot do are
straightforward over REST, and one thing BLE does well has no REST equivalent at all.

This doc is the REST counterpart to `docs/ble/protocol.md`: it records what the transport
actually is on real hardware, what each endpoint does on *this* camera and firmware, and
what remains unknown. It is not a restatement of Blackmagic's published specs — those
describe an API; a given camera implements some subset of it, sometimes badly.

### Why the sweep comes before any code

Three defects were already found by hand on `POCKET_6K_G2 v8.6`, all by accident:

| Endpoint | Observed | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /system` | `204 No Content` | Documented as returning a `SystemResponse`; returns nothing |
| `GET /system/videoFormat` | `501 Not Implemented` | Not available on this device |
| `GET /system/codecFormat` | `501 Not Implemented` | Not available on this device |
| `GET /mounts/<volume>/Stills/` | `500 Internal Server Error` | **Firmware defect** — the parent and the individual files both work |

If three turned up by accident, more will turn up on purpose. So the first deliverable of
the REST work is evidence, not architecture: sweep every endpoint, record what each one
actually returns, and only then decide which BLE functionality can move.

This is the HTTP analogue of design principle 6 — *never copy protocol values from one
profile to another without re-verifying*. A sweep's results are evidence about one
`(model_key, firmware, transport)` triple and nothing else.

## The transport is USB, not LAN

The camera presents a **USB Ethernet gadget** and serves HTTP over it. Everything
recorded in this doc so far was observed over a USB cable between the camera and a
Windows laptop — not over Wi-Fi, and not over a shared network.

That is the same channel `docs/ble/photo_capture.md` §7.3 proposed as a way out of the
photo-verification deadlock ("`POCKET_6K_PRO v8.6` exposes an HTTP interface over USB
where clips/photos can be browsed and played back from a PC"). This work is that TODO,
on the interface it actually named.

Four consequences that shape the design:

1. **No mDNS.** `\\pocket-cinema-camera-6k-g2.local` does not resolve — consistent with
   the operator's report that Windows Explorer cannot reach it by name. The camera's
   address is the USB adapter's **default gateway**: `ipconfig` and look for the "Remote
   NDIS" adapter, or read it off the camera's own Setup screen. Running
   `probe_endpoints.py` without `--host` prints the candidate gateways it can see, but
   deliberately does not guess — picking the wrong one means sweeping some other device
   and filing the results as if they were the camera's.
2. **The address can change** across reconnects, so `--host` is always explicit and never
   cached in a profile. Profiles record per-endpoint behaviour; they do not record where
   the camera lives.
3. **The link is single-host and disappears** on unplug, camera sleep, or power cycle.
   BLE handles its equivalent with `_reconnect_loop()` and liveness detection
   (`docs/ble/winrt_ble_connection_hardening.md`); REST has no answer for it yet. Whether
   the interface survives a full recording is **unverified** and needs checking before
   anything depends on it.
4. **USB results are not LAN results.** Moving to Wi-Fi means re-running the sweep, for
   the same reason a new firmware means re-sniffing. `probe_endpoints.py` records
   `--transport usb|lan` in every report so a reader can never mistake one for the other.

**First-run failure worth ruling out:** Windows Firewall classifying the RNDIS adapter as
a *Public* network will make every endpoint report unreachable. Check that before
concluding the camera is at fault.

SMB is enabled on the camera but non-functional in this setup, and FTP is enabled but
outside the scope of this work. Neither is used.

## What the sweep must answer

These questions gate the phases that follow. None of them can be answered from the specs.

| Question | What it decides |
|---|---|
| Does `PUT /system/format` exist (not 501)? | Whether settings can move to REST at all. With `/system/codecFormat` and `/system/videoFormat` both 501, `/system/format` is the **only** format surface — if its PUT is also unimplemented, codec/resolution/fps stay on BLE |
| Does `GET /system/supportedFormats` work? | Whether capability discovery is a runtime query or stays a hand-maintained profile table |
| Which WS properties actually subscribe? | Whether write verification has a real primary channel |
| Is `PUT /transports/0/record` implemented? | Whether record start/stop can move to REST |
| Are the 5xx defects wider than Stills? | How photo confirmation has to be built |
| Does `/clips/list` expose stills, sizes, or timestamps? | Whether photo confirmation needs filename probing at all, or something far simpler |
| Is `sensorResolution` writable via `PUT /system/format`? | Whether REST solves the Sensor Area problem `docs/ble/photo_capture.md` §10 closed as unsolvable over BLE |
| Does `/transports/0/timecode` return decimal or hex-valued BCD? | Whether `timecode.py`'s BCD decode can be reused |
| Does the USB interface stay up across a recording, and while BLE is connected? | Whether REST recording is safe, and whether the hybrid photo path is possible |

## `tools/rest/probe_endpoints.py`

Standalone and dependency-light: `aiohttp` only, importing nothing from the camera
package, so it runs against the repository exactly as it stands. Nothing has to be
refactored before evidence can be gathered.

Its pure logic — endpoint catalog, path expansion, status classification, summary
rendering, profile-block emission — is unit-tested in
`tests/unit/tools/rest/test_probe_endpoints.py` with no network and no `aiohttp`
installed. Only the functions that actually talk to the camera need the dependency.

### Mode 1: read-only (default)

Changes nothing on the camera; safe to re-run.

- `GET` every path from the ten published control specs, plus `/clips/list` (which no
  uploaded spec covers, but which the operator confirmed works).
- Fill `{deviceName}` from a live `/media/workingset` read. A template with no known
  device names is **dropped**, not requested literally — a 404 for the path
  `/media/devices/{deviceName}` would be a fact about the tool, not the camera.
- `GET /event/list` — the camera's own authoritative list of subscribable WS properties,
  which may differ from `Notification.yaml`'s `x-propertyName` enum. Both sets are tried
  and compared.
- Open the WebSocket and subscribe to each property **individually**. One property per
  request, never a batch: a batch that fails tells you nothing about which member caused
  it. Same reasoning as one capture window per setting in the BLE sniffers.
- Walk the `/mounts/` tree breadth-first, recording each level, and explicitly reach the
  Stills directory so every run either reproduces the known 500 or shows it fixed.

Requests are issued **sequentially**. A camera serving this over a USB gadget is not a
load-test target, and parallel requests would make a failure impossible to attribute.

### Mode 2: `--probe-writes` (opt-in, typed-yes gated)

No `GET` can tell you whether a `PUT` is implemented, and a real `PUT` changes camera
state. The way out is an **idempotent probe**: read the current value, write that exact
value straight back, and record the status code.

- `501` → not implemented.
- `200`/`204` → implemented.

Either answer arrives without changing a single setting.

Several endpoints report more fields than their `PUT` accepts, so the value read is
reshaped before being sent back:

| Endpoint | Reshaping |
|---|---|
| `/video/shutter` | Drops the read-only `continuousShutterAutoExposure`; sends `shutterSpeed` or `shutterAngle` |
| `/lens/iris` | Sends one of `apertureStop` > `normalised` > `apertureNumber`, the spec's documented priority |
| `/lens/zoom` | Sends `focalLength` or `normalised` |
| `/audio/channel/N/level` | Sends `gain` or `normalised` (gain is prioritised) |
| `/media/active` | Sends `workingsetIndex` only |
| `/transports/0` | Echoes `InputPreview`/`Output`; **skips** when the camera reports `InputRecord`, which its PUT cannot accept and which means the camera is mid-take |

Anything that cannot be reshaped into a valid body is skipped rather than guessed at — a
fabricated request would test the tool's imagination, not the camera.

**Never probed, at any value** (`NEVER_WRITE`), because these change state regardless of
what is sent:

```
/media/devices/{deviceName}/doformat   erases the card
/transports/0/record                   starts/stops recording
/transports/0/play                     starts playback
/transports/0/stop                     stops playback
/timelines/0            (DELETE)       clears the timeline
/timelines/0/add        (POST)         mutates the timeline
/lens/focus/doAutoFocus                moves the lens
/video/whiteBalance/doAuto             re-measures white balance
```

A unit test asserts the catalog agrees with that list, so wiring a write builder onto a
destructive endpoint fails in CI rather than on real hardware.

**Honest limitation, recorded in every report:** a same-value PUT may be a camera-side
no-op, so a `200` proves the *endpoint exists*, not that a *changing* write applies.
That second question belongs to the phase that needs it — and the BLE work has a
precedent for exactly this trap (`docs/ble/settings.md` §11, §14: every settings family
goes silent on a redundant write).

### Output

Three artefacts per run:

1. A printed summary grouped by classification, **worst first** — `server_error` above
   `unreachable` above `not_implemented` above `ok`. A 500 buried under forty 200s is a
   500 nobody reads.
2. A raw JSON report under `tools/captures/rest/<MODEL_KEY>_<FIRMWARE>/` (gitignored,
   alongside the BLE captures), carrying full response bodies, latencies, and the
   same-value-PUT caveat.
3. A ready-to-paste REST profile block, the same way
   `tools/control/discover_command.py` emits a `commands` block.

`501` is deliberately classified apart from other `5xx`. The first is the camera
correctly saying "this device does not do that"; the second is a firmware defect.
Conflating them would hide the exact class of problem the sweep exists to find. Only
`ok` counts as `supported` — a `server_error` endpoint is reachable but broken, which is
worse than absent, because at the call site it looks like a transient failure worth
retrying.

The emitted block leaves **`format_names` empty on purpose**. Deriving REST codec strings
(`"BRaw:5_1"`, `"ProRes:HQ"`) needs `/system/supportedFormats`; inventing them from a
naming rule would be exactly the kind of unverified protocol value design principle 1
exists to keep out of this repo.

### Usage

```
python tools/rest/probe_endpoints.py --host <camera-ip> \
    --model-key POCKET_6K_G2 --firmware v8.6
python tools/rest/probe_endpoints.py --host <camera-ip> \
    --model-key POCKET_6K_G2 --firmware v8.6 --probe-writes
```

Run without `--host` to print candidate gateway addresses.

`--model-key` and `--firmware` are **required, with no defaults** — matching the
convention for `tools/control/` scripts, where the target is never implicit because the
results get filed as evidence against it.

Run it **per camera and per transport**. `POCKET_6K_G2 v8.6` over USB says nothing about
`POCKET_6K_PRO v8.6`, even on the same firmware version — the BLE work already has two
profiles on the same firmware diverging on a real protocol value
(`recording_format`'s data-type byte, `0x82` on v7.9 vs `0x02` on v8.6).

## Sweep results

*(Empty. Populate from a real run — one section per `(model_key, firmware, transport)`,
in the evidentiary style of `docs/ble/settings.md`: what was run, what came back, and
what remains unexplained. Do not fill this in from the specs.)*

### `POCKET_6K_G2 v8.6` over USB

Not yet swept. Confirmed by hand before any tooling existed:

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /system/format` | works | codec, frameRate, offSpeedEnabled, offSpeedFrameRate, recordResolution, sensorResolution |
| `GET /video/iso` | works | `{"iso": 400}` |
| `GET /video/whiteBalance` | works | `{"whiteBalance": 5600}` |
| `GET /video/shutter` | works | `{"shutterAngle": 18000}` |
| `GET /media/workingset` | works | active media, device name, clip count, remaining/total space, remaining record time |
| `GET /clips/list` | works | e.g. `{"clipUniqueId": 3, "filePath": "/mnt/sd0/A001/A001_07311253_C001.mov"}` |
| `GET /mounts/` | works | |
| `GET /mounts/<volume>/` | works | |
| `GET /mounts/<volume>/Stills/<file>.dng` | works | direct download by known filename |
| `GET /mounts/<volume>/Stills/` | **500** | firmware defect; treat as permanently unusable |
| `GET /system` | **204** | no body |
| `GET /system/videoFormat` | **501** | |
| `GET /system/codecFormat` | **501** | |
| WS subscribe `/media/active` | works | `{"type": "response", "success": true}` |
| WS subscribe `/system/format` | works | |
| WS subscribe `/transports/0/record` | works | |

**No write endpoint has been exercised on any camera.**

Note the WS response shape above: `success` arrives at the **top level**, while
`Notification.yaml` documents it nested under `data`. The tool accepts both.

### `POCKET_6K_PRO v8.6`

Not swept. Nothing above transfers.

## What has no REST equivalent

- **Photo capture trigger.** None of the ten specs contains a stills-capture endpoint;
  `TransportControl.yaml` covers record, play, stop, and playback only. The BLE trigger
  (`0x0A`/`0x03`, VOID — `docs/ble/photo_capture.md` §7, §9) stays. What REST can supply
  is the *confirmation* that BLE never had.
- **Camera slate metadata** (BLE category `0x0C`: Reel, Scene, Take, Camera ID, Operator,
  Director, Project). No MetadataControl spec was supplied. Unknown, not absent — the
  sweep answers it.
- **Untethered operation.** BLE needs nothing plugged in; REST currently needs the cable.
  This is the reason the BLE stack stays functional rather than being retired.

## New capability REST brings

Beyond replacing BLE functionality, the specs describe control surfaces this repo has
never had: ISO, gain, white balance and tint, shutter, ND filter, auto-exposure; lens
iris, zoom, focus and autofocus; per-channel audio input, level, phantom power, padding,
low-cut filter; the full DaVinci-style colour corrector; and playback with a real
timeline. All of it unverified until swept.

---

## Security note

No authentication and no TLS appear anywhere in the specs or in anything observed. This
is plaintext control over a point-to-point USB link, which is a materially lower exposure
than the same API on a shared network — worth remembering if the transport ever moves to
Wi-Fi.
